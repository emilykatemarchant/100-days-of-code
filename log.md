# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: June 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've signed up for FreeCodeCamp and GitHub and I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I'm almost completely new to coding - having done a few things before on Codecademy and other free sites. I especially find it hard to stick with something when it's a little more conceptually challenging - or I don't understand the bare bones of something. So I'm committing to this in order to get through that first barrier without getting put off by the fact that I can't learn completely from the ground up.
