# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: June 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've signed up for FreeCodeCamp and GitHub and I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I also did a little bit of work on how to use GitHub.

**Thoughts** I'm almost completely new to coding - having done a few things before on Codecademy and other free sites. I especially find it hard to stick with something when it's a little more conceptually challenging - or I don't understand the bare bones of something. So I'm committing to this in order to get through that first barrier without getting put off by the fact that I can't learn completely from the ground up.

### Day 2: June 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: The best bit of today was going off FreeCodeCamp onto w3school to pursue something I wasn't understanding - Bootstrap grid rules. I am so happy with myself that I did it!

### Day 3: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp lessons. Started on jQuery and learned about class and id selectors and .addClass. Basic but having fun!

**Thoughts** Had a poor weekend what with the EUref and then camping... but I'm determined to get back onto it. Finding that the logical problem solving stuff is super fun.
